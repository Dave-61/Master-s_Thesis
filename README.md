In my master’s thesis, I designed a novel integer programming model for the transportation planning problem of an auto industry supply chain in Iran, where a set of trucks are used to transport goods from suppliers to their corresponding customers via three transportation systems: direct shipment, shipment through cross-dock (indirect shipment) and milk-run logistics. Since the proposed problem formulation is NP-hard, I developed an innovative optimization approach based on harmony search (HS), which is a variation of genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing (SA), called **HS-SA algorithm**, to solve the problem. The objective of this problem is to minimize the total shipping cost in the network, so the proposed algorithm endeavours to reduce the number of required trucks using an efficient vehicle routing strategy. Solving several numerical examples demonstrates that our solution approach outperforms the commercial package **GAMS/CPLEX** in reducing both the shipping cost in the network (*up to 40%*) and computational time requirement (*up to 56%*). <br>
